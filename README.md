VSWR - Module
==============================================

## Project:

For the radioberry this module gives the possibility for getting information about the vswr during transmit.

The module contains the possibility to measure the REF and FORWARD power.

Using a low speed i2c module makes it possible to read the data using the raspberry pi.

I have plans to add the reading:

-) to a seperate program to showing the measured data.
-) in the hpsdr emulator
-) in the pihpsdr plugin. 


Something about the setup.

The original design appeared in 1989 / 1990 SPRAT Magazine G-QRP
Also in the famous dutch QRP nieuwsbrief (NB 62) if found the article: "SWR METER ZONDER AFREGELING" door PAoWDW
I found it also in the openhpsdr ALEX project.

I did add the slow ADC i2c (as seen in the hermeslite version 2 design) 

## KICAD
Used KICAD to make the scheme and PCB.

Beside all this iam learning KICAD (stepped over from EAGLE). 
I like the KICAD program, much to learn, used start drawing a scheme. 
Add footprints and creating a PCB.

## Ordering
I ordered 6 January 2018 10 pcb at elecrow.

In the Netherlands it is possible to order at https://muxtronics.nl/ the components using the ShopCart from farnell.
